Today we are releasing Deno 1.5.0. This release contains a few new fetaures,
many feature stabilizations, and a ton of bug fixes. Here are some highlights:

<!--TODO(lucacasonato): summary of highlights-->

If you already have Deno installed you can upgrade to 1.5 by running
`deno upgrade`. If you are installing Deno for the first time, you can use one
of the methods listed below:

```shell
# Using Shell (macOS and Linux):
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh

# Using PowerShell (Windows):
iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex

# Using Homebrew (macOS):
brew install deno

# Using Scoop (Windows):
scoop install deno

# Using Chocolatey (Windows):
choco install deno
```

# New features and changes

## New and improved bundling

Since the last release we have been hard at work to refactor our entire
TypeScript compiler infrastructure. Because of this we were able to replace our
aging bundling infrastructure with a new and shiny bundler based on
[swc](https://swc.rs/).

This has led to a **2x performance improvement** when we type-check your code,
and up to a **20x improvement** if you use the `--no-check` flag ðŸš€.

In addition to the performance improvements the bundler is now capable of tree
shaking your code. This means it will remove code from the bundle that you are
not actually using. This leads to a major size reductions in bundles. For
example a bundle of the
[file_server example](https://deno.land/std/http/file_server.ts) is **35%
smaller** in 1.5 when comparing to 1.4.

Bundles are now also emitted as a standard ES module, which means that dynamic
import will work correctly now, and `import.meta.url` is also set correctly. If
you were using Deno to bundle code for the browser, make sure to load the bundle
as an ES module now (`type="module"` attribute on your `<script>` tag).

## `alert`, `confirm`, and `prompt` added

This release adds the web platform APIs `alert`, `confirm`, and `prompt`. These
have the same functions as they do in the browser:

- `alert` logs a message to the terminal, and then synchronously blocks until
  you confirm (with `[Enter]`).
- `confirm` prompts the user with a message, and then synchronously blocks until
  the user responds with either `y` or `n` (to signal `yes` or `no`).
- `prompt` requests some input from the user, and blocks synchronously until the
  user has entered the text and pressed `[Enter]`.

Here is a little demo of these functions in action. You can try it out by
running `deno run https://deno.land/posts/v1.5/alert_confirm_prompt.js`.

```js
let name = "";

while (true) {
  name = prompt("What is your name?");

  if (confirm(`Are you sure ${name} is your name?`)) {
    break;
  }
}

alert(`Hello ${name}!`);
```
